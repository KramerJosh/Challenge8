# Challenge 08

## Introduction/Installation

Welcome to my submission for Challenge 08 - TypeScript and OOP: Vehicle Builder.

In order to use this program, you'll need to install the correct dependancies and possibly create the dist directory the javascript file will land in if you'd like to run this program as a javascript file.

Please navigate to the Parent Directory (Challenge 8) and open a gitBash terminal.  In the terminal first please enter 
```code
npm i
```
to install the necessary dependancies and create a package-lock.json. When you are ready to begin, please enter
```code
npm start
```
This will create the /dist directory, as well as start the typescript program in your terminal.

## Using the Application

Now that you have everything installed and the program is running in the command line, you are able to follow the prompts and select actions to perform on vehicles stored in the system.  If you'd like, you may also input new Cars, Trucks, or Motorbikes.  
Use the arrow and return keys to navigate through the various prompts, and have fun interacting with the vehicles.

## Video Walkthrough
